# Four2Ten

Four2Ten is a multi-player online mobile game built with Flutter. In this game, you will use addition, subtraction, multiplication and division to form numbers to form ten (10) with the given digits while competing with your friends and see who's the fastest!

# Project Structure
## Frontend
Most of the frontend Dart code can be found in the `flutter_frontend/lib` directory.

## Backend
Most of the backend code can be found in the `backend_server` directory, inside `server.js` file.
The backend server is hosted on Google App Engine. Click on the `backend_server` directory to read more
about its specifications in its README. 

# Current Progress
Currently, an MVP version of the game has been completed. Basic functionalities of the app are fully working, including creating/joining a room, specifying game parameters, playing the game in both **multi-player** and **solo** mode, etc.

Below are some demos using Android emulators. The emulators communicate and coordinate through the actual backend hosted on Google App Engine.
